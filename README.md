# XAI for Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction

This project explores the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to improve the transparency and interpretability of machine learning models for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction. Using the Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction dataset, the study evaluates traditional and modern algorithms while integrating post-hoc explanation methods such as **SHAP**, **LIME**, and **Counterfactual explanations**.

The main objectives are:
- To develop and evaluate predictive models for CVD risk.  
- To apply and compare multiple XAI techniques for interpretability.  
- To identify the most influential features contributing to cardiovascular disease risk.  
- To promote transparency and trust in data-driven medical decision-making.
